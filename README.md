# Taylor Swift Tableau Project
For the Taylor Swift Tableau Project, I cleaned a dataset featuring all of her songs up to Evermore and created a dashboard in Tableau. I have been a huge fan of Taylor Swift since the beginning, so it was a lot of fun to see how she has changed throughout the years since she is such a dynamic artist.
